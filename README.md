Aim : To find DC operating point,find gain using transient analysis and AC analysis.

Components : Mosfet,resistors,DC power supply.

Procedure :

• Make the circuit connection as show above.

• Connect the RD resistor to the drain terminal and DC power supply to the gate terminal as well as to the resistor.

• Connect the source terminal to the ground.

• Set the input voltage to 0.9 V and VDD to 1.8 V.

Using the Formula for Power, 

P=V*I

We will get the Values of Id as,

Id= 5.56 * 10^-5 A

we have to get the output current, Id for the given circuits by adjusting the values of L & W( Length and Width of the Channel of the MOSFET)

Length and Width of the Channel used to obtain the given Current is shown in the figure below;

1) DC ANALYSIS:

   Procedure for Performing DC Analysis:
   we have to select the dc output print(DC op pnt) in the Edit Simulation Command and Run the Simulation
